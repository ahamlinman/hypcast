# This Dockerfile is designed to produce multi-architecture images without
# emulating the target architecture on the build host (which can be very slow).
# The images are based on Alpine Linux with a custom build of GStreamer, where
# all C components are built with LLVM.
#
# Why a custom GStreamer? Alpine 3.16 and up ship gst-plugins-ugly without the
# mpeg2dec plugin, which is an absolute requirement for Hypcast. As a bonus, we
# can reduce the image size by only including plugins we actually need. We
# still use Alpine's versions of GLib and the underlying codecs.
#
# Why LLVM? Alpine does not ship a full set of gcc-based cross toolchains for
# every build host architecture (e.g. no x86_64 toolchain on aarch64 hosts).
# Even if it did, the consistency of the LLVM-based setup provides greater
# confidence that a build executed on one architecture will work on others.
